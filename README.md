# `extract`

This program will accomplish three things: (1) read a PDF and extract sample location names and GPS coordinates; (2) convert to decimal deggrees format, and (3) plot converted coordinates to a map.

### In development 

Developers can install the program using `git clone`

`git clone git@github.com:aparnac25/extract.git`

Currently the `pip install` is not working. Hopefully soon one can use below code to run on command line.

`cd ./extract`

`pip install -e .`


Need to also install `tika` and it needs java to run 

`pip install tika`
